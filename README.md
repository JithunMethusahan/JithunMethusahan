## 👋 Hey there, I’m Jithun Methusahan

🔭 I’m currently working on AI-driven web applications and automation tools that make digital workflows faster, smarter, and actually useful.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI agents, system design, and scalable full-stack architecture (React, Node.js, Supabase, and beyond).

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source AI projects, developer tools, and innovative web apps with real-world impact.

🤔 I’m looking for help with optimizing AI system performance and fine-tuning LLM behavior for production-grade applications.

💬 Ask me about AI integration, web app development, or building from scratch using modern JavaScript frameworks.
